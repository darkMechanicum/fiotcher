# Want do
1. Separate processor from single tracking type.
2. More precise and deterministic test framework to test asynchronous flows.
3. Create own publisher/subscriber implementation, rather than default Java API, since
   some usage flaws were spotted.
4. Performance tests.
5. Concurrency stress tests with jcstress.
6. Test events aggregation more aggressively.
7. Just be cool. And lucky.
